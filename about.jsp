    <p>    
                 Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge.
                   A vast amount of the knowledge that would be valuable to many 
                  people is currently only available to a few — either locked 
                  in people’s heads, or only accessible to select groups. We 
                   want to connect the people who have knowledge to the people 
                  who need it, to bring together people with different 
                   perspectives so they can understand each other better, and 
                   to empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit
                   of the rest of the world.</p>

                       <p>
                           The heart of Quora is questions — questions that affect 
                           the world, questions that explain recent world events, 
                          questions that guide important life decisions, and questions 
                          that provide insights into why other people think differently.
                          Quora is a place where you can ask questions you care about 
                          and get answers that are amazing.

                         Quora has only one version of each question. It doesn’t have 
                         a left wing version, a right wing version, a western version, 
                         and an eastern version. Quora brings together people from 
                         different worlds to answer the same question, in the same
                         place — and to learn from each other. We want Quora to be 
                         the place to voice your opinion because Quora is where the 
                         debate is happening. We want the Quora answer to be the 
                         definitive answer for everybody forever.

       <p>
           Quora has content you will feel good about having read. 
           Quora helps you understand why the world works the way it does,
           why people behave the way they do, and what we can all do to make the world better.
           Quora provides a personalized feed of insightful answers to questions you hadn’t realized you should ask.

Quora’s answers come from people who really understand the issues and have first-hand knowledge. 
Quora is the place to read Barack Obama on the Iran deal, prisoners on life in prison, scientists 
on global warming, police officers on how to deter burglars, and TV producers on
how their shows are made. Quora is the place to read inspiring people such as Gloria Steinem, 
Stephen Fry, Hillary Clinton, Glenn Beck, Sheryl Sandberg, Vinod Khosla, and Gillian Anderson
directly answering the questions people most wanted them to answer. Quora is where you can 
read important insights that have never been shared anywhere else, from people 
you could never reach any other way.
